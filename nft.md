You need to load real money $$$ into an account like kucoin/coinbase (with your c/c, bank acc or paypal etc).
Once you tranfer your money into Eth and it's in your kucoin/coinbase account, you can withdraw it onto your metamask wallet...

- https://www.kucoin.com/assets/withdraw
- use wallet address (ie from metamask)
- ERC20

You need to convert ETH to WTH before you can make a bid on https://opensea.io/

# Misc

Notes:

- Setup 2FA on all accounts
- For metamask, keep your password and phrase SAFE. Don't share them
- If you have $10,000's+++ it may not be wise to let others manage your wallet. Using online wallets for non-life-changing amounts is good for getting started

https://metamask.io/ - Metamask is a browser extention which is an ethereum wallet. It let's you trade a lot of eth tokens back and forth that aren't otherwise listed on exchanges. You'll need to already have some eth or some eth based token to transfer to your wallet before you can use it though

robinhood - Robinhood doesn't actually give you access to a wallet though so you can't actually use your crypto there, just buy or sell to and from USD.
