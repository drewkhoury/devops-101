You need to load real money $$$ into an account like kucoin/coinbase (with your c/c, bank acc or paypal etc).
Once you tranfer your money into Eth and it's in your kucoin/coinbase account, you can withdraw it onto your metamask wallet...

- https://www.kucoin.com/assets/withdraw
- use wallet address (ie from metamask)
- ERC20

You need to convert ETH to WTH before you can make a bid on https://opensea.io/

# Getting money into a crypto account

Services like coinbase, kucoin, wyre via metamask etc will allow you to transfer money from your bank account/cards, however:

- credit cards (some banks may deny this as a policy, or just trigger it as fraud and you may need to call to unblock the transaction)
- debit cards -  may be an easier option (but only for small amounts unless the service allows you to up the limit)
- wire transfer or connect to your bank will give the opporutnity for more funds to be transfered

# Misc

Notes:

- Setup 2FA on all accounts
- For metamask, keep your password and phrase SAFE. Don't share them
- If you have $10,000's+++ it may not be wise to let others manage your wallet. Using online wallets for non-life-changing amounts is good for getting started
