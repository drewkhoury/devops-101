# üîê Security, and other Tools for the Modern Software Delivery Pipeline

A curated list of key tools for integrating security and best practices into software pipelines.

### üõ°Ô∏è Snyk
- **What it does**: Developer-first platform for SAST, SCA, container, and IaC security.
- **Why it's good**: Actionable remediation, Git/CI/CD/IDE integrations, great developer experience.
- **Security features**: SAST, open source CVE scanning, policy gates, license checks, auto-fix.
- **Link**: [https://snyk.io](https://snyk.io)

---

### üö© LaunchDarkly
- **What it does**: Enables progressive delivery, kill switches, and targeting.
- **Why it's good**: Control rollout of risky code, minimize blast radius.
- **Security features**: Role-based access, audit logs, encryption, quick rollbacks.
- **Link**: [https://launchdarkly.com](https://launchdarkly.com)

---

### ü§ù PactFlow (SmartBear)
- **What it does**: Validates service contracts (Pact) to prevent integration errors.
- **Why it's good**: Prevents data exposure and service breakages in distributed systems.
- **Security features**: Centralized broker, secure API contract storage, access control.
- **Link**: [https://pactflow.io](https://pactflow.io)

---

### üîç Veracode
- **What it does**: Enterprise-grade SAST, DAST, and SCA.

# ‚úÖ BDD & Testing Tools for Secure Software Delivery

While not strictly "security tools," these frameworks help prevent logic flaws, improve collaboration, and enforce security-related behaviors via automated testing.

| Tool | Category | What it Does | Security/Quality Role | Link |
|------|----------|---------------|------------------------|------|
| **Cucumber** | BDD | Write human-readable test cases in Gherkin syntax tied to step definitions | Aligns product, dev, test, and security for shared understanding | [https://cucumber.io](https://cucumber.io) |
| **SpecFlow** | BDD (.NET) | Gherkin-based BDD framework for .NET and Visual Studio | Enables BDD in Microsoft ecosystems | [https://specflow.org](https://specflow.org) |
| **Behave** | BDD (Python) | BDD testing for Python using Gherkin-style syntax | Consistent BDD for Python codebases | [https://behave.readthedocs.io](https://behave.readthedocs.io) |
| **Gauge** | BDD / Functional Testing | Markdown-based test automation framework by ThoughtWorks | Simpler alternative to Cucumber with strong plugin support | [https://gauge.org](https://gauge.org) |
| **Karate** | API Testing + BDD | Combines API tests, mocks, and performance testing using a DSL | Great for API validation and security behavior regression | [https://karatelabs.io](https://karatelabs.io) |
| **TestCafe** | E2E Testing | End-to-end web testing framework for modern browsers | Useful for testing authentication, sessions, access control | [https://testcafe.io](https://testcafe.io) |
| **Cypress** | E2E Testing | Fast, modern testing framework for front-end apps | Test critical security paths like login, logout, and redirects | [https://www.cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io) |
| **Playwright** | E2E Testing | Cross-browser automation with headless and CI-friendly setup | Enables secure UI behavior validation | [https://playwright.dev](https://playwright.dev) |
| **OWASP ZAP BDD Hooks** | Security + BDD | Allows ZAP scanning to be integrated with BDD flows | Embeds passive security scanning into acceptance tests | [https://owasp.org/www-project-zap](https://owasp.org/www-project-zap) |
| **Gherkin + Pact** | Contract + BDD | Combine BDD syntax with consumer-driven contract testing | Prevents insecure or breaking API changes | [https://docs.pact.io](https://docs.pact.io) |

## üõ°Ô∏è Example Gherkin for Security Acceptance

```gherkin
Scenario: Unauthenticated user cannot access admin panel
  Given I am not logged in
  When I try to access /admin
  Then I should receive a 401 Unauthorized error
```

Use BDD scenarios like this to formalize and test security rules early and automatically.
